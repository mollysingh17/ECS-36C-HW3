# HW3

This is a markdown (md) file representing an 
on-going design for assignment 3 for ECS36C.

## Problem Statement

• Download the hw03.cpp file from Canvas -> Assignments -> Homework03.
• Write your code (in C++) in the designated positions in hw03.cpp
• The purpose of the homework is to practice using some of the concepts gone over in class. The problems
in the first two functions must be solved using stacks. You may use std::stack. If you don’t solve them with
the stack, no points will be given.
• To submit, upload hw03 to Gradescope. Because of the way the autograder on Gradescope is configured,
the file must be named hw03; otherwise, the test cases will not run and you will not get any points.
• Only some of the functions will be for code. It may be different for each student.
• The main portion of your points will come from your explanation. Please make sure to document each line
of code and write a small statement explaining your thought process underneath the function in the
comments.
• You may upload as many times as you want before the deadline. Each time the autograder will let you know
how many of the test cases you have passed/failed. To prevent people from manipulating the autogader,
the content of half of the test cases are hidden.
• Please do not copy others’ answers. Autograder can detect similar code. Also, for your own benefit, do not
try to find solutions online.
